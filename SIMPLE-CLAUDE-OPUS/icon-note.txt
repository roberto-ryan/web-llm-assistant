Note: You'll need to add an icon.png file (128x128 pixels) in the src/ directory.

You can:
1. Use any 128x128 PNG image
2. Create a simple one with an online tool
3. Use this as a placeholder: Download any AI/robot icon and resize it to 128x128

The extension will work without it, but Chrome will show a default icon.
